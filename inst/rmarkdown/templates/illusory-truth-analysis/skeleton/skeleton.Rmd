Importing data from files in subdirectory ``r subdir``.

```{r import}
sess <- read_csv(file.path(subdir, "ANON_sessions.csv"),
                 col_types = "cfll") %>%
  mutate(list_id = fct_relevel(list_id,
                               levels(stimulus_conditions[["list_id"]])))

phase <- read_csv(file.path(subdir, "ANON_phases.csv"),
                  col_types = "cfill") %>%
  mutate(phase_id = fct_relevel(phase_id, as.character(1:4)))

interest <- read_csv(file.path(subdir, "ANON_interest.csv"),
                     col_types = "cfii") %>%
  mutate(stim_id = fct_relevel(stim_id,
                               levels(stimulus_conditions[["stim_id"]])))

ratings <- read_csv(file.path(subdir, "ANON_ratings.csv"),
                    col_types = "cffii") %>%
  mutate(phase_id = fct_relevel(phase_id, as.character(1:4)),
         stim_id = fct_relevel(stim_id,
                               levels(stimulus_conditions[["stim_id"]])))

n_item <- ratings %>% distinct(stim_id) %>% nrow()
```

## Pre-registered Exclusions

The anonymized files contain `r .pi(nrow(ratings))` truth ratings of
`r .pi(n_item)` statements from `r .pi(nrow(sess))` participants. Any
participants who did not provide consent for the entire study will
already have had their data removed during the pre-processing
stage. Also any phases of the study where a participant withheld
consent (despite consenting overall) will also have already been
removed before this stage.

### Participant-level exclusions

There were two main exclusion criteria for removing participants:

1. Not being a (self-reported) native speaker of English;
2. Reporting having looked up answers in at least one phase of the study.

```{r remove-nonnative}
sess_native <- sess %>%
  filter(chk_native)

n_nonnative <- nrow(sess) - nrow(sess_native)

sess_keep0 <- sess_native %>%
  filter(chk_nocheat)

n_noncomply <- nrow(sess_native) - nrow(sess_keep0)
```

Applying these two criteria resulted in the removal of 
`r .pi(n_nonnative)`
non-native English speaking participants and
`r if (n_nonnative > 0L) {"an additional"}`
`r .pi(n_noncomply)` participants who reported looking up answers.

```{r exclude}
## remove truth ratings from excluded participants
ratings2 <- ratings %>%
  semi_join(sess_keep0, "ID")

## remove interest ratings while we're at it
interest2 <- interest %>%
  semi_join(sess_keep0, "ID")
```

Removing data from these 
`r .pi(n_nonnative + n_noncomply)`
participants resulted in the removal of 
`r .pi(nrow(ratings) - nrow(ratings2))` truth ratings.

### Phase-level exclusions

There were two main exclusion criteria applying to the data from each
phase of the study:

1. Whether the participant completed all of the ratings in the phase;
2. Whether the participant completed the phase in a reasonable time, namely:
	* Between 3 and 40 minutes for Phase 1, and
	* Between 1 and 30 minutes for Phase 2, 3, and 4.

```{r phase-finished}
## criterion 1
phase_finished <- phase %>%
  filter(chk_finished)

n_incomplete <- nrow(phase) - nrow(phase_finished)

## criterion 2
phase_keep <- phase_finished %>%
  filter(chk_dur) 

n_duration <- nrow(phase_finished) - nrow(phase_keep)

## now remove the truth ratings
ratings_keep <- ratings2 %>%
  semi_join(phase_keep, c("ID", "phase_id")) 

## also remove the interest ratings
interest_keep <- interest2 %>%
  semi_join(phase_keep %>% filter(phase_id == "1"), "ID")
```

Applying these criteria resulted in the removal of 
`r .pi(n_incomplete)` incomplete phases and
`r .pi(n_duration)` additional phases that were not completed 
in a reasonable amount of time,
leading to the removal of 
`r .pi(nrow(ratings2) - nrow(ratings_keep))` truth ratings
associated with these phases.

## Descriptive statistics

```{r kill-orphans}
## make sure there are no entries in sess_keep0 for subjects
## who have lost all of their phase data.
sess_keep <- semi_join(sess_keep0, ratings, "ID")

n_orphaned <- nrow(sess_keep0) - nrow(sess_keep)
```

```{r orph-txt, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
if (n_orphaned) {
  cat("The phase exclusions above combined with dropouts meant ",
      "that an additional ",
      n_orphaned,
      " participants were left with no ratings data.", sep = "")
}
```

After all dropouts and exclusion criteria, there were 
`r .pi(nrow(sess_keep))` participants remaining for analysis, who
contributed a total of `r .pi(nrow(ratings_keep))` ratings.

### Dropouts

Below is a table of the number of subjects who completed each phase.

```{r dropouts}
## we need this quick lookup table
plookup <- stimulus_conditions %>%
  distinct(interval) %>%
  mutate(phase_id = factor(1:4))

phase_keep %>%
  inner_join(plookup, "phase_id") %>%
  distinct(ID, interval) %>%
  count(interval)
```

### Means and standard deviations

```{r assign-cond}
## lookup which condition each rating belongs to
ratecond <- ratings %>%
  inner_join(sess_keep %>% select(ID, list_id), "ID") %>%
  inner_join(stimulus_conditions, c("list_id", "stim_id"))
```

First, let's collapse over interval and look at the means and SDs for repetition.

```{r rep-means-sd}
ratecond %>%
  group_by(repetition) %>%
  summarise(mean = round(mean(trating), 2),
            `standard deviation` = round(sd(trating), 2))
```

Now let's look at the repetition effects for each interval.

```{r cell-means-sd}
ratecond %>%
  group_by(repetition, interval) %>%
  summarise(mean = round(mean(trating), 2),
            sd = round(sd(trating), 2)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = c(repetition),
              values_from = c(mean, sd)) %>%
  mutate(diff = round(mean_repeated - mean_novel, 2)) %>%
  select(interval, mean_repeated, mean_novel, diff, sd_repeated, sd_novel)
```

## Inferential statistics

```{r inferential, results='asis', echo = FALSE}
if (!params$inferential) {
  cat("**NOTE**: Because the statistical procedures can take a long time, ",
      "they are disabled by default. ",
      "To enable them, knit the source file ",
      "with the parameter `inferential` set to `TRUE`.\n", sep = "")
}
```

```{r inf-main, results='asis', echo = FALSE}
if (params$inferential) {cat("### Main effect\n* TODO\n")}
```

```{r inf-int, results='asis', echo = FALSE}
if (params$inferential) {cat("### Interaction\n* TODO\n")}
```

## Session information

```{r exit}
## before exiting, print out session info
sessionInfo()
```
