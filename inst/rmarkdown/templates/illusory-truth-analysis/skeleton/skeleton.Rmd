## Instructions for reproducing these analyses

The [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html) source document used to create this file is included with the [truthiness](https://github.com/dalejbarr/truthiness) package that accompanies this project.

To access and edit a copy of this file, after installing truthiness 
(`devtools::install_github("dalejbarr/truthiness")`)
use one of the two methods below.

If you are using RStudio, simply go to the pull down menu 
`File -> New... -> R Markdown` and choose "Illusory Truth Analysis" from the list of available templates.

Another option that does not depend on RStudio is to type the following command in the RStudio console.


```{r rmarkdown-file, eval=FALSE}
rmarkdown::draft("my_analysis.Rmd", "illusory-truth-analysis", "truthiness")
```

This command will create the file `my_analysis.Rmd` in the working directory, which can then be edited and compiled.


## Import and preprocess


```{r packages, message = FALSE}
## Load in the required add-on packages.

## library("truthiness")
devtools::load_all("../../truthiness")
library("tidyverse")

## shortcut for pretty printing for integers
.pi <- function(x) prettyNum(x, big.mark=',')
```

```{r subdir, echo = FALSE}
subdir <-
  if (is.null(params$subdir)) {
    dirs <- grep("^anon-[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}",
                 list.dirs(".", FALSE, recursive = FALSE), value = TRUE)
    if (length(dirs) == 0L) {
      stop("No data subdirectories found and params$subdir was NULL.\n",
           "       If you wish to create sample data, use:\n",
           "       truthiness::simulate_resp_files() and then\n",
           "       truthiness::preprocess().")
    }
    dirs[length(dirs)]
  } else {
    params$subdir
  }
```

Importing data from files in subdirectory ``r subdir``.

```{r import}
sess <- read_csv(file.path(subdir, "ANON_sessions.csv"),
		 col_types = "cill")

phase <- read_csv(file.path(subdir, "ANON_phases.csv"),
		  col_types = "ciill")

interest <- read_csv(file.path(subdir, "ANON_interest.csv"),
		     col_types = "ccii")

ratings <- read_csv(file.path(subdir, "ANON_ratings.csv"),
                    col_types = "cicii")

n_item <- ratings %>% distinct(stim_id) %>% nrow()
```

## Pre-registered Exclusions

The anonymized files contain `r .pi(nrow(ratings))` truth ratings of
`r .pi(n_item)` statements for `r .pi(nrow(sess))` participants. Any
participants who did not provide consent for the entire study will
already have had their data removed during the pre-processing
stage. Also any phases of the study where a participant withheld
consent (despite consenting overall) will also have already been
removed before this stage.

### Participant-level exclusions

There were two main exclusion criteria for removing participants:

1. Not being a (self-reported) native speaker of English;
2. Reporting having looked up answers in at least one phase of the study.

```{r remove-nonnative}
sess_native <- sess %>%
  filter(chk_native)

n_nonnative <- nrow(sess) - nrow(sess_native)

sess_keep <- sess_native %>%
  filter(chk_nocheat)

n_noncomply <- nrow(sess_native) - nrow(sess_keep)
```

Applying these two criteria resulted in the removal of 
`r .pi(n_nonnative)`
non-native English speaking participants and
`r if (n_nonnative > 0L) {"an additional"}`
`r .pi(n_noncomply)` participants who reported looking up answers.

```{r exclude}
## remove truth ratings from excluded participants
ratings2 <- ratings %>%
  semi_join(sess_keep, "ID")

## remove interest ratings while we're at it
interest2 <- interest %>%
  semi_join(sess_keep, "ID")
```

Removing data from these 
`r .pi(n_nonnative + n_noncomply)`
participants resulted in the removal of 
`r .pi(nrow(ratings) - nrow(ratings2))` truth ratings.

### Phase-level exclusions

There were two main exclusion criteria applying to the data from each
phase of the study:

1. Whether the participant completed all of the ratings in the phase;
2. Whether the participant completed the phase in a reasonable time, namely:
	* Between 3 and 40 minutes for Phase 1, and
	* Between 1 and 30 minutes for Phase 2, 3, and 4.

```{r phase-finished}
## criterion 1
phase_finished <- phase %>%
  filter(chk_finished)

n_incomplete <- nrow(phase) - nrow(phase_finished)

## criterion 2
phase_keep <- phase_finished %>%
  filter(chk_dur)

n_duration <- nrow(phase_finished) - nrow(phase_keep)

## now remove the truth ratings
ratings_keep <- ratings2 %>%
  semi_join(phase_keep, c("ID", "phase_id"))

## also remove the interest ratings
interest_keep <- interest2 %>%
  semi_join(phase_keep %>% filter(phase_id == "1"), "ID")
```

Applying these criteria resulted in the removal of 
`r .pi(n_incomplete)` incomplete phases and
`r .pi(n_duration)` additional phases that were not completed 
in a reasonable amount of time,
leading to the removal of 
`r .pi(nrow(ratings2) - nrow(ratings_keep))` truth ratings
associated with these phases.

## Descriptive statistics

### Dropouts

## Inferential statistics

```{r inferential, results='asis', echo = FALSE}
if (!params$inferential) {
  cat("**NOTE**: Because the statistical procedures can take a long time, ",
      "they are disabled by default. ",
      "To enable them, knit the source file ",
      "with the parameter `inferential` set to `TRUE`.\n", sep = "")
}
```

## Session information

```{r exit}
## before exiting, print out session info
sessionInfo()
```
