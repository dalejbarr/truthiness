Description: Data and functions for analyzing and simulating illusory
    truth datasets, developed as part of a longitudinal study by
    Henderson, Barr, and Simons (2020). The illusory truth effect is
    the observation that people rate repeated statements as more
    likely to be true than novel statements. We tested the trajectory
    of the illusory truth effect by collecting truth ratings for
    statements repeated across four time intervals: immediately, one
    day, one week, and one month following initial presentation. The
    package contains the anonymized data from the study along with
    stimulus materials, as well as functions for analyzing the data,
    running simulations, and calculating power. Further details about
    the project are available at <https://osf.io/nvugt/>, which
    includes Stage 1 of the Registered Report at the Journal of
    Cognition (<https://osf.io/vqnx2/>).
