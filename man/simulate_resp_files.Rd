task faster than the cutoff time ('Duration (in seconds)' less
than \code{duration_range_1[1]} for Phase 1, less than
\code{duration_range_all[1]} for all other phases).}

consent to a phase of the study.}

English speaker.}

same key over and over for at least one phase.}

acceptable task durations for Phase 1.}

acceptable task durations for Phases 2, 3, and 4.}

\value{

\description{
Simulate response data files from the rating study
}
\details{
Simulates response data and writes a set of CSV files out
  to \code{path} in Qualtrics format. The file names are of the
  format \code{PXLY.csv}, where X is the phase number (1-4) and Y
  is the list number (1-8). So P2L6.csv is the file for phase 2 of
  list 6.
