\usage{
gen_data(nsubj, thresh = alpha_6_to_7(clmm_maximal$alpha), raw_eff = 0,
  subj_rfx = ordinal::VarCorr(clmm_maximal)$subj_id,
  item_rfx = ordinal::VarCorr(clmm_maximal)$item_id, dropout = c(0.05,
  0.1, 0.1))
}
\arguments{
\item{nsubj}{Number of subjects. Because of counterbalancing, must
be a multiple of 8.}

\item{thresh}{Cut-points (thresholds) for the seven point scale
(must be a six-element vector).}

\item{raw_eff}{Raw effect size for the interaction term of the
model. Use 0 for testing Type I error rate, and .14 for an effect
of approximately 1/10 of a scale point.}

\item{subj_rfx}{A 4x4 covariance matrix with by-subject variance
components for the intercept, main effect of repetition, main
effect of interval, and repetition-by-interval interaction. Only
the variances (elements on the diagonal) are used in the
simulation (see Details).}

\item{item_rfx}{A 4x4 covariance matrix with by-statement variance
components for the intercept, main effect of repetition, main
effect of interval, and repetition-by-interval interaction. Only
the variances (elements on the diagonal) are used in the
simulation (see Details).}

\item{dropout}{A vector encoding assumptions about the proportion
of subjects dropping out of the study over the four testing
intervals (immediate, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month). The first element
represents the proportion of subjects who completed the first
phase (immediate) but who drop out before the next interval one
day later. The second element represents the proportion of the
remaining participants dropping out after 1 day and before 1
week. The third and final element represents the proportion of
remaining participants dropping out after 1 week and before 1
month. For example, the default values of .05, .1, and 1 encode
dropout rates of 5\%, 10\%, and 10\%.}
}
\value{
A data frame, with \code{nsubj * 128} rows and 11 variables, where:

\describe{

\item{\code{subj_id}}{Unique subject identifier.}

\item{\code{list_id}}{Which set of statements the subject received.}

\item{\code{item_id}}{Unique stimulus (statement) identifier.}

\item{\code{repetition}}{Whether the statement was old or new.}

\item{\code{interval}}{Testing interval (immediate, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month).}

\item{\code{eta}}{The simulated response tendency, on the log odds scale.}

\item{\code{trating}}{The simulated rating value.}

\item{\code{R}}{Deviation-coded predictor for repetition (old = 1/2,
  new = -1/2).}

\item{\code{I1}}{Deviation-coded predictor for interval comparing baseline
  (immediate) to 1 day.}

\item{\code{I2}}{Deviation-coded predictor for interval comparing
  baseline (immediate) to 1 week.}

\item{\code{I3}}{Deviation-coded predictor for interval comparing
baseline (immediate) to 1 month.}

\details{
By default, the thresholds and parameter estimates for
  variance components used in the simulation are from the
  cumulative logit mixed model fit to the Nadarevic and Erdfelder
  data. Only the variances from the by-subject and by-item
  covariance matrices are used. Unlike Nadarevic and Erdfelder, who
  only had two testing intervals, the simulated study assumes four
  intervals, coded by three predictors for the main effect and
  three for the interaction with repetition. The code below depicts
  how the four-element variance vector from the original study is
  translated into the eight variances needed for the simulated
  data.

\code{newvar_subj <- rep(diag(subj_rfx), c(1, 1, 3, 3))}

\code{newvar_item <- rep(diag(item_rfx), c(1, 1, 3, 3))}

The simulated data includes ratings for 128 stimulus items for each
  subject. Half of the statements are repeated (old) and half are
  new.  A quarter of the items (32) are tested at each phase.

It is assumed that the key effect present in the data is the
interaction term, which is designed to represent an illusory-truth
effect that first appears at the second testing interval (1 day)
and remains over the subsequent two intervals without changing
size. All other fixed effects in the model (main effect of R and
three effects encoding the main effect of interval) are driven by
the interaction term.
